    "- **NumberOfLines()**\n",
    "    - every path returns an int\n",
    "    - first major step: you will need the length of the message, so use the *message.length()* to find it\n",
    "    - from there you have some options College Board decided if there was any remaining characters after each line is split at the width. If there was, they returned 1 extra line, otherwise they returned the number of characters devided by the line length.\n",
    "- **getLines()**\n",
    "    - every path returns a String, *(in this case null is a string without a memory address)*\n",
    "    - first they check for the null case\n",
    "    - next they created an empty string to build onto\n",
    "    - third they created a for loop with steps equalivant to the number of lines\n",
    "    - at each step in the for loop, they concatenate the **signLines** with the substring of the line and a semicolon to signify the end of the line.\n",
    "    - finally, after the for loop, they concatenate the **signLines** with the remaining characters in the message."
